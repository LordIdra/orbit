# ORBIT
WIP orbital visualisation in C++ using SDL2 and OpenGL. 

Currently implements N-body simulation, though I've recently switched to 2-body and am implementing tesselation for orbit visualisation.
My first real attempt at a long-term project that follows a clear structure and is maintainable.
