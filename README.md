# Overview
Half-finished 2D N-body simulation project in C++ using SDL2 and OpenGL. This was my first real attempt at a long-term project that follows a clear structure and is maintainable, and in some regards it has succeeded, in others not so much. I later followed this up with a 3D version with a much better structure and far more impressive capabilities. This project can be found here: https://github.com/LordIdra/OSTRICH
